STRUCTURED = """Write a complete valid Fibo 2.0 scene JSON object. Supported scene fields are short_description (string), objects (list of descriptive objects), background_setting (string), lighting (object), aesthetics (object), photographic_characteristics (object), style_medium (string), context (string), artistic_style (string), and text_render (list of objects with a text string). Omit unused sections.
Use semantic spatial descriptions in objects; there is no numeric-coordinate or bounding-box schema. Assign each subject and string to one owning element without duplicate objects. Every intended visible string must appear in text_render with exact text, and can include a location description. In descriptions quote any mentioned display strings with JSON-escaped double quotes. Close every quote, object and array; shorten descriptive detail to fit the response budget instead of truncating.
Complete example:
{"short_description":"A cream travel poster showing blue mountains and the title \\"EXPLORE\\".","objects":[{"description":"A layered blue mountain silhouette in the center"}],"background_setting":"Warm cream paper","style_medium":"Editorial poster","text_render":[{"text":"EXPLORE","location":"Large title above the mountains"},{"text":"Find your next trail","location":"Small subtitle below the mountains"}]}

For this editing task, put the scene object described above inside structured_caption.
The final response MUST have exactly these two required top-level fields: structured_caption and edit_instruction.
edit_instruction is a nonempty string stating the requested change and what to preserve. Reference images in supplied order as <image_1>, <image_2>, etc.
Complete final-response example:
{"structured_caption":{"short_description":"The source portrait with a red leather jacket"},"edit_instruction":"Change the jacket in <image_1> to red leather. Preserve the person's face, pose, lighting and background."}
Before returning, verify that BOTH top-level fields are present and that every intended visible string appears in structured_caption.text_render.
